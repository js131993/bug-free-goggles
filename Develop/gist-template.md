# REVIEW OF REGEX

For this assignment, I will be reviewing the following topics in REGEX.

## Summary

I will be covering different topics in regex, which include anchors, quanitifiers, OR Operator, Character Classes, flags, (grouping and capturing), Bracket Expressions, greedy and lazy match, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead and look-behind.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
An anchor does not match any character. These match a certain position amongst the characters. The position can be at the beginning, middle or end of the characters. 

Anchors are used to check positional boundaries.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify the how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.

There are greedy and lazy quantifiers. Greedy reresents the longest possible string that can be produced and lazy is the shortest possible string. *?  The question mark turns the greedy quantifier to the lazy quantifier.
### OR Operator
The OR operator returns a boolean value.  The boolean value will be true if either or both operands is true.  Otherwise it is false.

The OR operator is shown by two pikes, shown to the right (||)
### Character Classes
A character class uses different characters to distinguish between letters and digits.
### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
